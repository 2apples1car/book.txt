One day you are a star,
The day after you are garbage,
Who are we to decide,
It's just molecules.
When I am with you I feel like a star.
When I am without you I feel like garbage.
When I'm with Kate?
Oh, I might never know how that feels.

Tiles on leather, skin on tiles
Year or the pandemic
Nothing will be the same

so many beautiful memories
a blossoming love
in the summer of the pandemic
美好回忆
盛开的爱
大流行的夏天

milk is white,
white is right, 
gas is the best
牛奶是白色的，
白人总是对的，
煤气却是最好的。
